                    <p class="section-content__item__text">
                        It seemed like an ordinary day at the police station when the chief commissioner giraffe
                        received a call from dispatch to respond to an emergency. Turns out there had been a break-in at
                        the toy store downtown. The giraffe got into his car and immediately drove to the scene. There
                        he found his partner, the panther, looking for clues about the suspects. Giraffe didn't wait any
                        longer and started checking the perimeter as well. Then he came across a clump of brown fur that
                        looked like the suspect's. Could it have been the squirrel, the rabbit or the cat? Who lost
                        their fur?
                        The giraffe went back to the police station, where the suspects were waiting to be questioned.
                        Just before entering the interrogation room, the giraffe noticed a missing fur patch on the cat.
                        He knew he had to change strategy, let the squirrel and rabbit go home, and confront Mr. Cat
                        with the evidence. The cat admitted the deed, returned the toys and went home with his tail
                        between his legs. The giraffe was again appreciated for his insight and attention to detail and
                        resumed his policing duties. Shall tomorrow be an incident-free day?

                    <p class="section-content__item__text">
                        Fire engine sirens can be heard in the distance. Thick smoke around the birch tree gradually
                        begins to engulf the entire forest. The little animals run out of the way of the fire, trying to
                        save their babies and personal belongings. The fire brigade, led by Mr. Giraffe, arrives at the
                        scene of the fire and urges people to calm down. The water hose is in place and in no time the
                        fire is extinguished. The animals applaud and congratulate the giraffe for his initiative and
                        ability to control the situation.
                        After assessing the damage, it was determined that only the rabbit's hutch suffered. The giraffe
                        stepped in again, mobilized the rest of the animals and helped Mr Rabbit to restore his hide.
                        The fire apparently started from a forgotten candle lit by the little bunnies. Before heading
                        back to the fire station, the bunny family promised the giraffe they would be more careful in
                        the future. The forest is once again a happy, safe place for animals to live.

                    <p class="section-content__item__text">
                        It's 8 o'clock, and the giraffe has already arrived at the construction site, excited about the
                        construction that has begun on the bear's den. The helmet is in place because protection is
                        important and the tool kit is ready. The location is dreamy, at the foot of the mountains, with
                        a lovely view. A day's construction work on a site like this is a real buzz.
                        Giraffe has a pretty easy job today. He has to hammer pieces of wood together to make a roof
                        over the entrance to the den. While the rest of the animals on the construction site finish the
                        inside, the giraffe is hammering and thinking about what it would be like to live here, to wake
                        up every morning and see the mountains. Of course, the den would have to be adapted a little to
                        its height, but nothing is impossible. At the end of a productive day on the site, the giraffe
                        promises again that one day he will work on his own house in the forest.

                    <p class="section-content__item__text">

                        The cold season brought crowds to the giraffe doctor's office. Animals come in complaining of a
                        sore throat or
                        headache, fever and chills. The doctor isn't worried, it's like this every year. The animals
                        don't seem to
                        understand that this season they need to protect themselves more.
                        It's decided. Today he's going to call the whole herd of forest animals and teach them how to
                        avoid the flu. Washing
                        your hands and eating a healthy diet with lots of fruit and vegetables are two essential rules
                        for strong immunity.
                        Rabbits seem a bit confused - how can they eat anything other than carrots? The bear also looks
                        confused, having
                        never eaten anything but blackberries. However, they are all willing to adopt dietary changes.
                        With a little help,
                        they'll avoid visits to Mr. Giraffe's office and enjoy good health. After all, no one likes to
                        catch the flu, do
                        they?

                    <p class="section-content__item__text">
                        Mr. Giraffe shows up for work every day at the butcher's shop, although he doesn't always enjoy
                        slicing every piece of meat. It's a trade that's been passed down from generation to generation,
                        with his father and grandfather proudly practicing the same craft. In the beginning, it was all
                        fun, the giraffe carefully wielding each knife, each ax to cut the meat or bones as efficiently
                        as possible. After a few years, however, he found it no longer brought him so much fulfillment.
                        The pay was good, but was it worth working long hours at a job you didn't enjoy?
                        As the days went by, the giraffe thought more and more about quitting. Until one day his father
                        visited him at the butcher's shop, picked up a knife and started working side by side. How proud
                        the father was that his son was carrying on his passion. The giraffe, seeing the happiness in
                        his father's eyes, remembered that the butcher's shop was his second home at first. From that
                        moment on he rediscovered the pleasure behind knives and axes, and every day he was on duty out
                        of respect for his father.

                        The clock read 6 o'clock when the giraffe got out of bed and headed straight for the law office. She must be ready for
                        today because she appears before the lion judge to defend the bunny. The story is much longer and more complex, but it
                        all boils down to the case of the rabbit who stole some carrots from the hedgehog's garden. The rabbit claims it wasn't
                        stealing, the hedgehog gave him permission to take 2 carrots from the garden, while the hedgehog claims that the rabbit
                        didn't limit himself to 2 carrots, but destroyed more than half of the crop. There are no witnesses, only the image of
                        the devastated garden. The giraffe has a tough job as defense counsel because the jury is made up of animals who have a
                        particular dislike of the rabbit.
                        10 o'clock. The trial begins in the middle of the forest. The rabbit and the hedgehog tell their story in front of the
                        jury, the giraffe takes over and asks the rabbit if he regrets what happened. The rabbit's honest answer and promise not
                        to do it again soften the jury. The hedgehog is not compensated because the rabbit must return the harvest in the
                        spring. Everyone is happy with the outcome of the trial, and the giraffe is already thinking about the next case on the
                        list.

                    <p class="section-content__item__text">
                        A few years ago, the giraffe stood out among forest animals as the first suitcase corporatist. Everyone admired Mr.
                        Giraffe every morning when he left for work dressed in a suit, tie and the ever-present suitcase. At the time, not much
                        was known about the job. Some animals spread rumors that the giraffe had joined the SRI, others said he was a detective.
                        When, lo and behold, the giraffe was a mere corporate man. All day long he sat at his desk, calling clients and solving
                        problem situations. It's a job that brings him a lot of satisfaction, but mostly a social status that the rest of the
                        animals in the forest only dream of. His office is on the highest hill in the region and has a splendid view of the
                        forest. No wonder the forest animals envy him! Giraffe tells them every day that although it's not easy being the
                        corporate suitcase, he wouldn't choose another job for anything. The animals sit and listen to him and dream...of a
                        corporate job.

                        A first for the animal world - after years of preparation, the giraffe is about to set off on its first trip to the
                        Moon, along with other astronauts. Ever since he was a child, the giraffe has dreamed of a career as an astronaut,
                        following in Neil Armstrong's footsteps. The launch of the Apollo 11 mission was watched with great interest and
                        excitement by the giraffe's family, and the little giraffe vowed that one day he would walk on the moon. Preparations
                        for his first mission were intense with lots of physical training and hours spent in the simulator. The giraffe trained
                        hard for his first mission. He knew there was no room for mistakes in space. The excitement grew as the big day
                        approached. The whole forest was waiting with bated breath for the giraffe's launch to the moon. Even more excited was
                        the expectation that the astronauts would return to Earth. They certainly had many stories to share with everyone, and
                        the giraffe wouldn't forget a detail! Take care in space, Mr. Giraffe! Your dream has come true!

                        The giraffe has an important mission today, to teach the bunny how to dive. He has made sure he has all the diving
                        equipment on him, he has repeated all the steps with the rabbit and now they are heading for the shore where they will
                        team up and step into the underwater universe. The rabbit is nervous because he doesn't like the water, but the giraffe
                        has convinced him that such an experience is worth trying for once in his life. He trusted the giraffe, had been a diver
                        for several years and had taken many forest animals diving. Now it was time for the bunny. The first step into the water
                        wasn't so bad. Neither was the second. Terror flashed across the rabbit's face as he realized he was going to go full
                        body into the water. The giraffe waved him to relax and breathe properly, as they rehearsed on shore. The rabbit began
                        to relax and discover the deep-sea universe and its wonders. The giraffe was right, the rabbit didn't seem to want to
                        get out of the water.

                        The giraffe is the most famous climber in the forest. He had learned how to conquer the mountains from a young age with
                        his parents. One by one he reached the highest peaks in the area, except for one that seemed impossible to reach. For
                        two years, the giraffe has trained hard, and now he feels his time has come. If he doesn't try to climb now, he never
                        will. So, he grabs his gear and food and sets off. The first stretch is easy and he does it in no time. He arrives at
                        the camp at the foot of the mountain, along with other climbers who want to venture up the peak. By day the blizzard is
                        heavy, and the giraffe decides it would be best to start climbing at night to avoid accidents. In the evening, full of
                        enthusiasm, he takes his first steps to the summit. The icy sections don't scare him, he knows it's a short climb to the
                        top. He climbs carefully, he knows the mountain won't forgive him. Another 100 meters to the top, and the giraffe feels
                        his strength starting to fail. He remembers an important lesson he learned from his parents - when you feel you can't go
                        any further, don't give up, rest. So, he pitches his tent and rests. The next day he sets off again with fresh strength.
                        He reaches the summit and great satisfaction comes over him. He dedicates the victory to his parents. They taught him
                        how to be a great climber.
